# Story Collecting Agent

## Overview
**Story Collecting Agent** is an AI-powered tool built using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with **Claude Desktop** (via stdio and HTTP).  
It collects **data points related to user NLP queries**, integrates with **Google Search** to fetch relevant stories, and organizes them into a **classified Excel format** stored locally.  

This project demonstrates how MCP-based agents can be integrated with search engines and structured storage to build a knowledge pipeline.

## Features
- Collects and processes **user NLP queries**  
- Fetches relevant information from **Google Search**  
- Stores results in **classified Excel spreadsheets** for easy analysis  
- Built with **MCP** for seamless integration with **Claude Desktop**  
- Dependency management using **uv** (faster, modern alternative to pip/venv)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**  
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed (for dependency management)  
- Claude Desktop with MCP enabled  

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AswinKumar1/Story_collecting_agent.git
cd Story_collecting_agent
````

Install dependencies using **uv**:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running the Application

Run the main agent:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

(Optional) Run debug/testing scripts:

```bash
uv run python debug.py
uv run python test.py
```

## How It Works

1. User enters a **query** (NLP text input).
2. Agent connects via **Claude Desktop MCP (stdio + HTTP)**.
3. Query is enriched and sent to **Google Search**.
4. Relevant stories/data are retrieved and classified.
5. Results are saved into structured **Excel files** locally.
